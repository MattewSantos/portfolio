                about me
            </h2>

            <p>
                My name is Matheus Rodrigues Santos I have 23 years old I grew up in a city of Goiania in Brazil
                social media: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-rodrigues-7432571a0/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>

            </p>
            <p>
                I usually feel motivated to push myself to not just provide results,
                but also help my workmates to achieve higher goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I face a challenge, I usually do some research
                on how to solve the situation with the better approach.
                If I am not sure or cannot solve it, I request assistance from my leader.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last time I had problem with code, I realized that making comments about every section, can avoid
                further mistakes that might face. And you should study the mistake that was 
                committed.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a project where I could learn way more about JavaScript, arrays, random number, and other
                calculation. With that, the user was able set several numbers and the software delivered data and
                metadata about the array of numbers and the numbers themselves.

                        This institution was my gateway to college where I started the computer science course but I
                        changed my course to systems analysis and development because I was looking for something more
                        focused on both web and local software development. There I learned the basics of programming
                        and logistics and a little bit of the c++ language.
